    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Avvi Singh and I'm a 22 year old aspiring software engineer from Melbourne, Australia. I am a Bachelor of Science student at the University of Melbourne, where I am currently majoring in Microbiology and Immunology. After 2 years of Science, I quickly discovered that though I am fascinated by the field and enjoy <em>learning</em> it, I don't picture myself working in the field. As such, I took a gap year and allowed myself the opportunity to discover other passions which I could turn into a career. And that is the story of how I came across Web Development.</p>

    <br>

    <p>TLDR; I want to be a Web Developer :D</p>
