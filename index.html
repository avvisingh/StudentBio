      <p>Hi! My names, Avvi and I'm a 22 year old aspiring Web Developer from Melbourne, Australia. I am currently about to complete my Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne with a Major in Microbiology and Immunology. After 2 years of my Science degree, I discovered that even though I love <em>learning</em>science, working as a researcher in the field was just not for me. As such, I gave myself a gap year to allow myself time to discover new passions. And that, is the story of how I stumbled upon the fascinating field of Web Development. I'll see you around.</p>
